The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-player game. It only needs the initial input.

The game is played on an infinite plane. However, I couldnt figured out how to do it, so the space for the game is limited in my project.
Each cell is either dead or alive and their status is updated in every generation.

There are only 2 rules:

    1- Dead cells which have exactly 3 alive neighbors comes to life in the next generation.
  
    2- Alive cells which have less than 2 or greater than 3 neighbors dies in the next generation.
